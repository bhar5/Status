Zero Defects Goals:
Shift-Left Testing – Encourage early defect detection by integrating unit tests, code reviews, and static analysis in the development lifecycle.
Code Quality Standards – Implement strict coding guidelines, automated linting, and peer reviews to reduce defects.
Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Promote writing tests before implementing code to ensure functionality aligns with requirements.
Automated Testing – Increase automation coverage for regression, integration, and performance testing.
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) – Conduct post-mortems to identify and eliminate recurring defects.
Continuous Improvement – Foster a culture of learning from defects and enhancing development processes.
Defect Prevention – Implement proactive measures like better requirement gathering, clear documentation, and pair programming.
Metrics & Monitoring – Track defect density, resolution time, and escaped defects to measure progress.
Mentoring Developers Goals:
Technical Guidance – Help developers improve coding skills, architecture understanding, and debugging techniques.
Code Reviews & Feedback – Provide constructive feedback during reviews to enhance best practices and maintainability.
Pair Programming & Collaboration – Encourage working in pairs to improve knowledge sharing and teamwork.
Career Development – Guide junior developers in setting career goals, learning new technologies, and improving soft skills.
Encourage Problem-Solving – Teach debugging strategies, algorithmic thinking, and efficient coding techniques.
Foster Innovation & Best Practices – Encourage experimentation with new tools, frameworks, and methodologies.
Knowledge Sharing – Organize tech talks, brown bag sessions, and documentation practices.
Emphasize Ownership & Accountability – Instill a mindset of responsibility for code quality, testing, and long-term maintainability.
